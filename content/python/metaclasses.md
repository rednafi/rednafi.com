In Python, metaclass is one of the few tools that enables you to inject metaprogramming
capabilities into your code. The term metaprogramming refers to the potential for a
program to manipulate itself in a self referential manner. However, messing with
metaclasses is often considered an arcane art that's beyond the grasp of the
proletariats. Heck, even
[Tim Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Peters_(software_engineer)) advices you
to tread carefully while dealing with these.

Metaclasses are an esoteric OOP concept, lurking behind virtually all Python code. Every
Python class that you create is attached to a default metaclass and Python cleverly
abstracts away all the meta-magics. So, you're indirectly using them all the time
whether you are aware of it or not. For the most part, you don’t need to be aware of it.
Most Python programmers rarely, if ever, have to think about metaclasses. This makes
metaclasses exciting for me and I want to explore them in this post to formulate my own
judgement. Let's dive in.

## Metaclasses

A metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. Like an "ordinary" class defines the
behavior of the instances of the class, a metaclass defines the behavior of classes and
their instances.

Metaclasses aren't supported by every object oriented programming language. Those
programming language, which support metaclasses, considerably vary in way they implement
them. Python provides you a way to get under the hood and define custom metaclasses.

## Understanding type and class

In Python, everything is an object. Classes are objects as well. As a result, all
classes must have corresponding types. You deal with built in types like `int`, `float`,
`list` etc all the time. Consider this example:

```python
a = 5

print(type(a))
print(type(int))
```

```
<class 'int'>
<class 'type'>
```

In the above example, variable `a` is an instance of the built in class `int`. Type of
`a` is `int` and the type of `int` is `type`. User defined classes also show similar
behavior. For example:

```python
class Foo:
    pass


a = Foo()

print(type(a))
print(type(Foo))
```

```
<class '__main__.Foo'>
<class 'type'>
```

Here, I've defined another class named `Foo` and created an instance `a` of the class.
Applying `type` on instance `a` reveals its type as `__main__.Foo` and applying `type`
on class `Foo` reveals the type as `type`. So here, we can use the term `class` and
`type` interchangeably. This brings up the question:

> What on earth this `type` (function? class?) thing actually is and what is the type of
> `type`?

Let's apply `type` on `type`:

```python
print(type(type))
```

```
<class 'type'>
```

Whaaaat? The type of any class (not instance of a class) in Python is `type` and the
type of `type` is also `type`. By now, you've probably guessed that `type` is a very
special class in Python that can reveal the type of itself and of any other class or
object. In fact, `type` is a metaclass and all the classes in Python are instances of
it. You can inspect that easily:

```python
class Foo:
    pass


for klass in [int, float, list, dict, Foo, type]:
    print(type(klass))

print(isinstance(Foo, type))
print(isinstance(type, type))
```

```
<class 'type'>
<class 'type'>
<class 'type'>
<class 'type'>
<class 'type'>
<class 'type'>
True
True
```

The the last line of the above code snippet demonstrates that `type` is also an instance
of metaclass `type`. Normally, you can't write self referential classes like that in
pure Python. However, you can circumvent this limitation by subclassing from `type`.
This enables you to write custom metaclasses that you can use to dictate and mutate the
way classes are created and instantiated. From now on, I'll be referring to the instance
class of a metaclass as *target class*. Let's create a custom metaclass that just prints
the name of the target class while creating it:

```python
class PrintMeta(type):
    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict):
        """__new__ gets executed before the target is created.

        Parameters
        ----------
        metacls : PrintMeta
            Instance of the the PrintMeta class itself
        cls : str
            Name of the class being defined (Point in this example)
        bases : tuple
            Base classes of the constructed class, empty tuple in this case
        classdict : dict
            Dict containing methods and fields defined in the class

        Returns
        -------
            instance class of this metaclass
        """

        print(f"Name of this class is: {cls}")
        return super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict)


class A(metaclass=PrintMeta):
    pass
```

```
Name of this class is A
```

Despite the fact that we haven't called class `A` or created an instance of it, the
`__new__` method of metaclass `PrintMeta` was executed and printed the name of the
target class. In the return statement of `__new__` method, `super()` was used to call
the `__new__` method of the base class (`type`) of the metaclass `PrintMeta`.

## Special methods used by metaclasses

Type `type`, as the default metaclass in Python, defines a few special methods that new
metaclasses can override to implement unique code generation behavior. Here is a brief
overview of these "magic" methods that exist on a metaclass:

* `__new__`: This method is called on the Metaclass before an instance of a class based
on the metaclass is created
* `__init__`: This method is called to set up values after the instance/object is created
* `__prepare__`: Defines the class namespace in a mapping that stores the attributes
* `__call__`: This method is called when the constructor of the new class is to be used
to create an object

These are the methods to override in your custom metaclass to give your classes
behaviors different from that of `type`. The following example shows the default
behaviors of these special methods and their execution order.

> Some people immediately think of `__init__`, and I’ve occasionally called it “the
> constructor” myself; but in actuality, as its name indicates, it’s an initializer and
> by the time it’s invoked, the object has already been created, seeing as it’s passed
> in as self. The real constructor is a far less famous function: `__new__`. The reason
> you might never hear about it or use it- is that allocation doesn’t mean that much in
> Python, which manages memory on its own. So if you do override `__new__`, it’d be just
> like your `__init__` —except you’ll have to call into Python to actually create the
> object, and then return that object afterward.

```python
class ExampleMeta(type):
    """Simple metaclass showing the execution flow of the
    special methods."""

    @classmethod
    def __prepare__(metacls, cls, bases):
        """Defines the class namespace in a mapping that stores
        the attributes

        Parameters
        ----------
        cls : str
            Name of the class being defined (Point in this example)
        bases : tuple
            Base classes for constructed class, empty tuple in this case
        """

        print(f"Calling __prepare__ method of {super()}!")
        return super().__prepare__(cls, bases)

    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict):
        """__new__ is a classmethod, even without @classmethod decorator

        Parameters
        ----------
        cls : str
            Name of the class being defined (Point in this example)
        bases : tuple
            Base classes for constructed class, empty tuple in this case
        classdict : dict
            Dict containing methods and fields defined in the class
        """

        print(f"Calling __new__ method of {super()}!")
        return super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict)

    def __init__(self, cls, bases, classdict):
        """This method is called to set up values after the
        instance/object is created."""

        print(f"Calling __init__ method of {super()}!")
        super().__init__(cls, bases, classdict)

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """This method is called when the constructor of the new class
        is to be used to create an object

        Parameters
        ----------
        args : tuple
            Position only arguments of the new class
        kwargs : dict
            Keyward only arguments of the new class

        """

        print(f"Calling __call__ method of {super()}!")
        print(f"Printing {self} args:", args)
        print(f"Printing {self} kwargs", kwargs)
        return super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)


class A(metaclass=ExampleMeta):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        print(f"Calling __init__ method of {self}")


a = A(1, 3)
```

```
Calling __prepare__ method of <super: <class 'ExampleMeta'>, <ExampleMeta object>>!
Calling __new__ method of <super: <class 'ExampleMeta'>, <ExampleMeta object>>!
Calling __init__ method of <super: <class 'ExampleMeta'>, <ExampleMeta object>>!
Calling __call__ method of <super: <class 'ExampleMeta'>, <ExampleMeta object>>!
Printing <class '__main__.A'> args: (1, 3)
Printing <class '__main__.A'> kwargs {}
Calling __init__ method of <__main__.A object at 0x7febe710a130>
```

Pay attention to the execution order of the special methods of the custom metaclass
`ExampleMeta`. The `__prepare__` method is called first and is followed by `__new__`,
`__init__` and `__call__` respectively. Only after that the first method `__init__` of
the target class `A` is called. This is important since it'll help you to decide how
you'll mutate and change the behavior of your target class.

## Metaclass conflicts

Note that the metaclass argument is singular – you can’t attach more than one metaclass
to a class. However, through multiple inheritance you can accidentally end up with more
than one metaclass, and this produces a conflict which must be resolved.

```python
class FirstMeta(type):
    pass


class SecondMeta(type):
    pass


class First(metaclass=FirstMeta):
    pass


class Second(metaclass=SecondMeta):
    pass


class Third(First, Second):
    pass


third = Third()
```

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

<ipython-input-340-6afe6bc8f8bc> in <module>
        11     pass
        12
---> 13 class Third(First, Second):
        14     pass
        15


TypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict)
subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases
```

Class `First` and `Second` are attached to different metaclasses and class `Third`
inherits from both of them. Since metaclasses trickle down to subclasses, class `Third`
is now effective attached to two metaclasses (`FirstMeta` and `SecondMeta`). This will
raise `TypeError`. Attachment with only one metaclass is allowed here.

## Examples in the wild

In this section, I'll go through a few real life examples where metaclasses can provide
viable solutions to several tricky problems that you might encounter during software
development. The solutions might appear over-engineered in some cases and almost all of
them can be solved without using metaclasses. However, the purpose is to peek into the
inner wirings of metaclasses and see how they can offer alternative solutions.

### Simple logging with metaclasses

The goal here is to log a few basic information about a class without directly adding
any logging statements to it. Instead, you can whip up a custom metaclass to perform
some metaprogramming and add those statements to the target class without mutating it
explicitly.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)


class LittleMeta(type):
    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict):
        logging.info(f"classname: {cls}")
        logging.info(f"baseclasses: {bases}")
        logging.info(f"classdict: {classdict}")

        return super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict)


class Point(metaclass=LittleMeta):
    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float) -> None:
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"


p = Point(5, 10)
print(p)
```

```
INFO:root:classname: Point
INFO:root:baseclasses: ()
INFO:root:attrs: {'__module__': '__main__', '__qualname__': 'Point', '__init__':
<function Point.__init__ at 0x7f436c2db790>, '__repr__': <function Point.__repr__ at
0x7f436c2db4c0>}


Point(5, 10)
```

In the above example, I've created a metaclass called `LittleMeta` and added the
necessary logging statements to record the information about the target class. Since
the logging statements are residing in the `__new__` method of the metaclass, these
information will be logged before the creation of the target class. In the target class
`Point`, `LittleMeta` replaces the default `type` metaclass and produces the desired
result by mutating the class.

### Returning class attributes in a custom list

In this case, I want to dynamically attach a new attribute to the target class called
`__attrs_ordered__`. Accessing this attribute from the target class (or instance) will
give out an alphabetically sorted list of the attribute names. Here, the `__prepare__`
method inside the metaclass `AttrsListMeta` returns an `OrderDict` instead of a simple
`dict` - so all attributes gathered before the `__new__` method call will be ordered.
Just like the previous example, here, the `__new__` method inside the metaclass
implements the logic required to get the sorted list of the attribute names.

```python
from collections import OrderedDict


class AttrsListMeta(type):
    @classmethod
    def __prepare__(metacls, cls, bases):
        return OrderedDict()

    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict, **kwargs):
        attrs_names = [k for k in classdict.keys()]
        attrs_names_ordered = sorted(attrs_names)
        classdict["__attrs_ordered__"] = attrs_names_ordered

        return super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict, **kwargs)


class A(metaclass=AttrsListMeta):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.y = y
        self.x = x


a = A(1, 2)
print(a.__attrs_ordered__)
```

```
['__init__', '__module__', '__qualname__']
```

You can access the `__attrs_ordered__` attribute from both class `A` and an instance of
class `A`. Try removing the `sorted()` function inside the `__new__` method of the
metaclass and see what happens!

### Creating a singleton class

In OOP term, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of
the class) at a time.

After the first time, if you try to instantiate a Singleton class, it will basically
return the same instance of the class that was created before. So any modifications
done to this apparently new instance will mutate the original instance since they're
basically the same instance.

```python
class Singleton(type):
    _instance = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instance:
            cls._instance[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instance[cls]


class A(metaclass=Singleton):
    pass


a = A()
b = A()

a is b
```

```
True
```

In the above example, at first, I've created a singleton class `A` by attaching the
`Singleton` metaclass to it. Secondly, I've instantiated class `A` and assigned the
instance of the class to a variable `a`. Thirdly, I've instantiated the class again and
assigned variable a `b` to this seemingly new instance. Checking the identity of the
two variables `a` and `b` reveals that both of them are actually the same object.

### Implementing a class that can't be subclassed

Suppose you want to create a base class where the users of your class won't be able to
create any subclasses from the base class. In that case, you can write a metaclass and
attach that your base class. The base class will raise `RuntimeError` if someone tries
to create a subclass from it.

```python
class TerminateMeta(type):
    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict):
        type_list = [type(base) for base in bases]

        for typ in type_list:
            if typ is metacls:
                raise RuntimeError(
                    f"Subclassing a class that has "
                    + f"{metacls.__name__} metaclass is prohibited"
                )
        return super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict)


class A(metaclass=TerminateMeta):
    pass


class B(A):
    pass


a = A()
```

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)

<ipython-input-438-ccba42f1f95b> in <module>
        20
        21
---> 22 class B(A):
        23     pass
        24

...

RuntimeError: Subclassing a class that has TerminateMeta metaclass is prohibited
```

### Disallowing multiple inheritance

Multiple inheritance can be fragile and error prone. So, if you don't want to allow the
users to use a base class with any other base classes to form multiple inheritance, you
can do so by attaching a metaclass to that target base class.

```python
class NoMultiMeta(type):
    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict):
        if len(bases) > 1:
            raise TypeError("Inherited multiple base classes!")
        return super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict)


class Base(metaclass=NoMultiMeta):
    pass


# no error is raised
class A(Base):
    pass


# no error is raised
class B(Base):
    pass


# This will raise an error!
class C(A, B):
    pass
```

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

<ipython-input-404-36c323db1ea0> in <module>
        18
        19 # This will raise an error!
---> 20 class C(A, B):
        21     pass

...

TypeError: Inherited multiple base classes!
```

### Timing classes with metaclasses

Suppose you want to measure the execution time of different methods of a class. One way
 of doing that is to define a timer decorator and decorating all the methods to measure
and show the execution time. However, by using a metaclass, you can avoid decorating
the methods in the class individually and the metaclass will dynamically apply the
timer decorator to all of the methods of your target class. This can reduce code
repetition and improve code readability.

```python
import inspect
import time
from functools import wraps


def timefunc(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        ret = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        run_time = end_time - start_time
        print(f"Executing {func.__qualname__} took {run_time} seconds.")
        return ret

    return wrapper


class TimerMeta(type):
    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict):
        new_cls = super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict)

        # key is attribute name and val is attribute value in attribute dict
        for key, val in classdict.items():
            if inspect.isfunction(val) or inspect.ismethoddescriptor(val):
                setattr(new_cls, key, timefunc(val))
        return new_cls


class Shouter(metaclass=TimerMeta):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def intro(self):
        time.sleep(1)
        print("I shout!")


s = Shouter()
s.intro()
```

```
Executing Shouter.__init__ took 9.5367431640625e-07 seconds.
I shout!
Executing Shouter.intro took 1.0011515617370605 seconds.
```

### Registering plugins with metaclasses

Suppose a specific single class represents a plugin in your code. You can write a
metaclass to keep track of all of the plugins so than you don't have to count them
manually.

```python
registry = {}


class RegisterMeta(type):
    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict):
        new_cls = super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict)
        registry[new_cls.__name__] = new_cls
        return new_cls


class A(metaclass=RegisterMeta):
    pass


class B(A):
    pass


class C(A):
    pass


class D(B):
    pass


b = B()
print(registry)
```

```
{'A': __main__.A, 'B': __main__.B, 'C': __main__.C, 'D': __main__.D}
```

### Debugging methods with metaclasses

Debugging a class often involves inspecting the individual methods and adding extra
debugging logic to those. However, this can get tedious if you've do this over an over
again. Instead, you can write an inspection decorator and use a metaclass to
dynamically apply the decorator to all of the methods of your target class. Later on,
you can simply detach the metaclass once you're done with debugging and don't want the
extra logic in your target class.

```python
import inspect
from functools import wraps


def debug(func):
    """Decorator for debugging passed function."""

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Full name of this method:", func.__qualname__)
        return func(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper


class DebugMeta(type):
    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict):
        new_cls = super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict)

        # key is attribute name and val is attribute value in the attrs dict
        for key, val in classdict.items():
            if inspect.isfunction(val) or inspect.ismethoddescriptor(val):
                setattr(new_cls, key, debug(val))
        return new_cls


class Base(metaclass=DebugMeta):
    pass


class Calc(Base):
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y


class CalcAdv(Calc):
    def mul(self, x, y):
        return x * y


mycal = CalcAdv()
print(mycal.mul(2, 3))
```

```
Full name of this method: CalcAdv.mul
6
```

### Exception handling with metaclasses

Sometimes you need to handle exceptions in multiple methods of a class in a generic
manner. That means all the methods of the class have the same exception handling,
logging logic etc. Metaclasses can help you avoid adding repetitive exception handling
and logging logics to your methods.

```python
import inspect
from functools import wraps


def exc_handler(func):
    """Decorator for custom exception handling."""

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            ret = func(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception:
            print("Exception Occured!")
            print(f"Method name: {func.__qualname__}")
            print(f"Args: {args}, Kwargs: {kwargs}")
            raise
        return ret

    return wrapper


class ExceptionMeta(type):
    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict):
        new_cls = super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict)

        # key is attribute name and val is attribute value in attribute dict
        for key, val in classdict.items():
            if inspect.isfunction(val) or inspect.ismethoddescriptor(val):
                setattr(new_cls, key, exc_handler(val))
        return new_cls


class Base(metaclass=ExceptionMeta):
    pass


class Calc(Base):
    def add(self, x, y):
        return x + y


class CalcAdv(Calc):
    def div(self, x, y):
        return x / y


mycal = CalcAdv()
print(mycal.div(2, 0))
```

```
Exception Occured!
Method name: CalcAdv.div
Args: (<__main__.CalcAdv object at 0x7febe692d1c0>, 2, 0), Kwargs: {}


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)

<ipython-input-467-accaebe919a8> in <module>
        43
        44 mycal = CalcAdv()

...

### Abstract base classes

An abstract class can be regarded as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to
provide a set of methods that must be implemented within any child classes built from
the abstract class. Abstract classes usually house multiple abstract methods. An
abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation.

When you want to provide a common interface for different implementations of a
component, abstract classes are the way to go. You can't directly initialize or use an
abstract class. Rather, you've to subclass the abstract base class and provide concrete
implementations of all the abstract methods. Python has a dedicated `abc` module to
help you create abstract classes. Let's see how you can define a simple abstract class
that provides four abstract methods:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class ICalc(ABC):
    """Interface for a simple calculator."""

    @abstractmethod
    def add(self, a, b):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def sub(self, a, b):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def mul(self, a, b):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def div(self, a, b):
        pass


intrf = ICalc()
```

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

<ipython-input-21-7be58e3a2a92> in <module>
        21
        22
---> 23 intrf = ICalc()


TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class ICalc with abstract methods add, div, mul, sub
```

Although it seems like interface `ICalc` is simply inheriting from the class `ABC`, in
fact, `ABC` is attaching a metaclass `ABCMeta` to `ICalc`. This metaclass transforms
the `ICalc` class into an abstract class. You can see that the class `ICalc` gives
`TypeError` when you take an attempt to initialize it. The only way to use this
interface is via creating subclasses from `ICalc` base class and implementing all the
abstract methods there. The snippet below shows that:

```python
class Calc(ICalc):
    """Concrete class that uses Icalc interface."""

    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def sub(self, a, b):
        return a - b

    def mul(self, a, b):
        return a * b

    def div(self, a, b):
        return a / b


calc = Calc()

print(calc.add(1, 2))
print(calc.sub(2, 3))
print(calc.mul(3, 4))
print(calc.div(4, 5))
```

### Metaclasses & dataclasses

Data classes were introduced to python in version 3.7. Basically they can be regarded
as code generators that reduce the amount of boilerplate you need to write while
generating generic classes. Dataclasses automatically create `__init__`, `__repr__`,
`__eq__`, `__gt__`, `__lt__` etc methods without you having to add them explicitly.
This can be very handy when you need to create custom collections for your data. You
can create dataclasses in the following manner:

#### Creating multiple dataclasses

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime


@dataclass(unsafe_hash=True, frozen=True)
class Event:
    created_at: datetime


@dataclass(unsafe_hash=True, frozen=True)
class InvoiceIssued(Event):
    invoice_uuid: int
    customer_uuid: int
    total_amount: float
    due_date: datetime


@dataclass(unsafe_hash=True, frozen=True)
class InvoiceOverdue(Event):
    invoice_uuid: int
    customer_uuid: int


inv = InvoiceIssued(
    **{
        "invoice_uuid": 22,
        "customer_uuid": 34,
        "total_amount": 100.0,
        "due_date": datetime(2020, 6, 19),
        "created_at": datetime.now(),
    }
)


print(inv)
```

```
InvoiceIssued(created_at=datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 20, 1, 3, 24, 967633),
invoice_uuid=22, customer_uuid=34, total_amount=100.0, due_date=datetime.datetime(2020,
6, 19, 0, 0))
```

#### Avoiding dataclass decorator with metaclasses

Now, one thing that I find cumbersome while creating multiple dataclasses is having to
attach the `@dataclasses.dataclass` decorator to each of the dataclasses. Also, the
decorator takes multiple arguments to customize the dataclass behavior and it can
quickly get cumbersome when you've to create multiple dataclasses with custom behavior.
Moreover, this goes against the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in software
engineering.

To avoid this, you can write a metaclass that will automatically apply the customized
dataclass decorator to all of the target classes implicitly. All you have to do is to
attach the metaclass to a base dataclass and inherit from it in the later dataclasses
that need to be created.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from datetime import datetime


class EventMeta(type):
    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict):
        """__new__ is a classmethod, even without @classmethod decorator

        Parameters
        ----------
        cls : str
            Name of the class being defined (Event in this example)
        bases : tuple
            Base classes of the constructed class, empty tuple in this case
        attrs : dict
            Dict containing methods and fields defined in the class
        """
        new_cls = super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, classdict)

        return dataclass(unsafe_hash=True, frozen=True)(new_cls)


class Event(metaclass=EventMeta):
    created_at: datetime


class InvoiceIssued(Event):
    invoice_uuid: int
    customer_uuid: int
    total_amount: float
    due_date: datetime


class InvoiceOverdue(Event):
    invoice_uuid: int
    customer_uuid: int


inv = InvoiceIssued(
    **{
        "invoice_uuid": 22,
        "customer_uuid": 34,
        "total_amount": 100.0,
        "due_date": datetime(2020, 6, 19),
        "created_at": datetime.now(),
    }
)

print(inv)
```

```
InvoiceIssued(created_at=datetime.datetime(2020, 6, 24, 12, 57, 22, 543328),
invoice_uuid=22, customer_uuid=34, total_amount=100.0, due_date=datetime.datetime(2020,
6, 19, 0, 0))
```

## Should you use it?

Almost all of the problems you've encountered above can be solved without using
metaclasses. Decorators can also be exclusively used to perform metaprogramming in a
more manageable and subjectively cleaner way. One case where you absolutely have to use
metaclasses is to avoid applying decorators to multiple classes or methods repetitively.

Also, metaclasses can easily veer into the realm of being a *“solution in search of a
problem“.* If the problem at hand can be solved in a simpler way, it probably should
be. However, I still think that you should at least try to understand how metaclasses
work to have a better grasp on how Python classes work in general and can recognize
when a metaclass really is the appropriate tool to use.

## Remarks

Wrapping your mind around metaclasses can be tricky. So, to avoid any unnecessary
confusion, I've entirely evaded any discussion regarding the behavioral difference
between *old style classes* and *new style classes* in Python. Also, I've intentionally
excluded mentioning the differences between `type` in Python 2 and `type` in Python 3
entirely. Python 2.x has reached its EOL. Save yourself some trouble and switch to
Python 3.x if you already haven't done so.

This article assumes familiarity with decorators, dataclasses etc. If your knowledge on
them is rusty, checkout these posts on [decorators](https://rednafi.github.io/digressions/python/2020/05/13/python-decorators.html) and [dataclasses](https://rednafi.github.io/digressions/python/2020/03/12/python-dataclasses.html).
