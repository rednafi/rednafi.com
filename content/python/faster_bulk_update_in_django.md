Django has a `Model.objects.bulk_update` method that allows you to update multiple
objects in a single pass. While this method is a great way to speed up the update
process, oftentimes it's not fast enough. Recently, at my workplace, I found myself
writing a script to update half a million user records and it was taking quite a bit of
time to mutate them even after leveraging bulk update. So I wanted to see if I could use
`multiprocessing` with `.bulk_update` to quicken the process even more. Turns out, yep
I can!

Here's a script that creates 100k users in a PostgreSQL database and updates their
usernames via vanilla `.bulk_update`. Notice how we're timing the update duration:

```python
# app_name/vanilla_bulk_update.py
import os

import django

# This allows us to run this module as a script inside a Django app.
os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "mysite.settings")
django.setup()

import time

from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Delete the previous users, if there's any.
User.objects.all().delete()

# Create 100k users.
users = User.objects.bulk_create(
    (User(username=f"user_{i}") for i in range(100_000)),
)

# Start time.
s1 = time.perf_counter()

# Update all the users' usernames to use upper case.
for user in users:
    user.username = user.username.upper()

# Save all the users. The batch_size determines how many records will
# be saved at once.
User.objects.bulk_update(users, ["username"], batch_size=1_000)

# End time.
e1 = time.perf_counter()

# Print the time taken.
print(f"Time taken to update 100k users: {e1 - s1} seconds.")

# Print a few usernames to see that the script has changed them as expected.
print("Updated usernames:")
print("===================")
for username in User.objects.values_list("username", flat=True)[:5]:
    print(username)
```

This can be executed as a script like this:

```
python -m app_name.vanilla_bulk_update
```

It'll return:

```
Time taken to update 100k users: 9.220380916005524 seconds.
Updated usernames:
===================
USER_99840
USER_99841
USER_99842
USER_99843
USER_99844
```

A little over 9 seconds isn't too bad for 100k users but we can do better. Here's how
I've updated the above script to make it 4x faster:

```python
# app_name/multiprocessing_bulk_update.py
import os

import django

# This allows us to run this module as a script inside a Django app.
os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "mysite.settings")
django.setup()

import multiprocessing as mp
import time

from django.contrib.auth.models import User

MAX_WORKERS = 2 * mp.cpu_count() - 1
CHUNK_SIZE = 1_000


def main():
    # Delete the previous users, if there's any.
    User.objects.all().delete()

    # Create 100k users.
    users = User.objects.bulk_create(
        (User(username=f"user_{i}") for i in range(100_000))
    )

    # Start time.
    s1 = time.perf_counter()

    # Mutate the usernames to use upper case.
    for user in users:
        user.username = user.username.upper()

    # Split the users into chunks for each process to work on. This returns
    # [[USER_0, USER_1, USER_2, ...], [USER_3, USER_4, USER_5, ...], ...]
    user_chunks = (
        users[i : i + CHUNK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(users), CHUNK_SIZE)
    )

    # Close the connection before forking.
    django.db.connections.close_all()

    # Create a pool of processes and run the update_users function on
    # each chunk.
    with mp.Pool(MAX_WORKERS) as pool:
        pool.map(update_users, user_chunks, chunksize=10)

    # End time.
    e1 = time.perf_counter()

    # Print the time taken.
    print(
        "Time taken to update 100k users with multiprocessing: "
        f"{e1 - s1} seconds."
    )

    # Print a few usernames to see that the script has changed them
    # as expected.
    print("Updated usernames:")
    print("===================")
    for username in User.objects.values_list("username", flat=True)[:5]:
        print(username)


def update_users(user_chunk):
    # The batch_size determines how many records will be saved at once.
    User.objects.bulk_update(user_chunk, ["username"], batch_size=CHUNK_SIZE)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script divides the updated user list into a list of multiple user chunks and
assigns that to the `user_chunks` variable. The `update_users` function takes a single
user chunk and runs `.bulk_update` on that. Then we fork a bunch of processes and run
the `update_users` function over the `user_chunks` via `multiprocessing.Pool.map`. Each
process consumes `10` chunks of users in a single go—determined by the `chunksize`
parameter of the `pool.map` function. Running the updated script will give you similar
output as before but with a much smaller runtime:

```
python -m app_name.multiprocessing_bulk_update
```

This will print the following:

```
Time taken to update 100k users with multiprocessing: 2.2682724999976926 seconds.
Updated usernames:
===================
USER_960
USER_961
USER_962
USER_963
USER_964
```

Whoa! This updated the records in under 2.5 seconds. Quite a bit of performance gain
there.

!!! Warning
    This won't work if you're using SQLite database as your backend since SQLite doesn't
    support concurrent writes from multiple processes. Trying to run the second script
    with SQLite backend will incur a database error.
