[Pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#introduction) can be a neat way to run
automated ad-hoc *tasks* before submitting a new git commit. These tasks may include
linting, trimming trailing whitespaces, running code formatter before code reviews etc.
Let's see how multiple Python linters and formatters can be applied automatically before
each commit to impose strict conformity on your codebase.

To keep my sanity, I only use three linters in all of my python projects:

* **[Isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort)**: `Isort` is a Python utility to
sort *imports* alphabetically, and automatically separate them by sections and type.

    It parses specified files for global level import lines and puts them all at the top
    of the file grouped together by the type of import:

    - Future
    - Python Standard Library
    - Third Party
    - Current Python Project
    - Explicitly Local (. before import, as in: `from . import x`)
    - Custom Separate Sections (Defined by `forced_separate` list in the configuration
    file)
    - Custom Sections (Defined by `sections` list in configuration file)

    Inside each section, the imports are sorted alphabetically. This also automatically
    removes duplicate python imports, and wraps long from imports to the specified line
    length (defaults to 79).

* **[Black](https://github.com/psf/black)**: `Black` is the uncompromising Python code
formatter. It uses consistent rules to format your python code and makes sure that they
look the same regardless of the project you're reading.

* **[Flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8)**: *Flake8* is a wrapper around
*PyFlakes*, *pycodestyle*,
Ned Batchelder's [McCabe script](https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe). The combination of
these three linters makes sure that your code is compliant with
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and free of some obvious code smells.

## Installing pre-commit

* Install using `pip`:

    ```python
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

* Install via `curl`:

    ```python
    curl https://pre-commit.com/install-local.py | python -
    ```

## Defining the pre-commit config file

Pre-commit configuration is a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file where you define your hooks
(tasks) that you want to run before every commit. Once you have defined your hooks in
the config file, they will run automatically every time you say `git commit -m "Commit
message"`. The following example shows how *black* and a few other linters can be added
as hooks to the config:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml

repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v2.3.0
    hooks:
    -   id: check-yaml
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 19.3b0
    hooks:
    -   id: black
```

## Installing the git hook scripts

Run

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This will set up the git hook scripts and should show the following output in your
terminal:

```
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Now you'll be able to implicitly or explicitly run the hooks before each commit.

## Running the hooks against all the files

By default, the hooks will run every time you say:

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

However, if you wish to run the hooks manually on every file, you can do so via:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Running the linters as pre-commit hooks

To run the above mentioned linters as pre-commit hooks, you need to add their respective
settings to the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. However, there're a few minor issues
that need to be taken care of.

* The default line length of `black` formatter is 88 (you should embrace that) but
`flake8` caps the line at 79 characters. This raises conflict and can cause failures.

* *Flake8* can be overly strict at times. You'll want to ignore basic errors like unused
imports, spacing issues etc. However, since your IDE / editor also points out these
issues anyway, you should solve them manually. You will need to configure *flake8* to
ignore some of these minor errors.

The following one is an example of how you can define your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and
configure the individual hooks so that *isort*, *black*, *flake8* linters can run
without any conflicts.

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml

# isort
- repo: https://github.com/asottile/seed-isort-config
  rev: v1.9.3
  hooks:
  - id: seed-isort-config
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-isort
  rev: v4.3.21
  hooks:
  - id: isort

# black
- repo: https://github.com/ambv/black
  rev: stable
  hooks:
    - id: black
      args: # arguments to configure black
        - --line-length=88
        - --include='\.pyi?$'

        # these folders wont be formatted by black
        - --exclude="""\.git |
          \.__pycache__|
          \.hg|
          \.mypy_cache|
          \.tox|
          \.venv|
          _build|
          buck-out|
          build|
          dist"""

      language_version: python3.6


# flake8
- repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
  rev: v2.3.0
  hooks:
    - id: flake8
      args: # arguments to configure flake8
        # making isort line length compatible with black
        - "--max-line-length=88"
        - "--max-complexity=18"
        - "--select=B,C,E,F,W,T4,B9"

        # these are errors that will be ignored by flake8
        # check out their meaning here
        # https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html
        - "--ignore=E203,E266,E501,W503,F403,F401,E402"
```

You can add the above lines to your configuration and run:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This should apply the pre-commit hooks to your code base harmoniously. From now on,
before each commit, the hooks will make sure that your code complies with the rules
imposed by the linters.
