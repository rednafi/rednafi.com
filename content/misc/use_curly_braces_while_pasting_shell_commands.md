Pasting shell commands can be a pain when they include hidden return `\n` characters. In
such a case, your shell will try to execute the command immediately. To prevent that,
use curly braces `{ <cmd> }` while pasting the command. Your command should look like
the following:

```bash
{ dig +short google.com }
```

Here the spaces after the braces are significant.
