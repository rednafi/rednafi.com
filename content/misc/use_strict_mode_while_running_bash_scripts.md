Use unofficial bash strict mode while writing scripts. Bash has a few gotchas and this
helps you to avoid that. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

echo "Hello"
```

Where,

```
-e              Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
-u              Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
-o pipefail     The return value of a pipeline is the status of
                the last command to exit with a non-zero status,
                or zero if no command exited with a non-zero status.
```

messing with the IFS without a valid reason.
